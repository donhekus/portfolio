					<h2>Fields of Expertise</h2>
					<article class="skill">
						<h3>Backend development</h3>
						<p>I spent most of my 8+ years of PHP experience with Laravel, which enabled me to see the architecture of things, and taught me how to design and develop applications in a reusable and scalable manner.</p>
						<p>I have experience in other frameworks such as Yii and Wordpress. In some of my free time I'm working on my very own content management system.</p>
					</article>
					<article class="skill">
						<h3>Frontend development</h3>
						<p>In the last 3 years I have made some really nice improvements in my frontend development skills with HTML and CSS, and for sure I have good experience in JavaScript and TypeScript programming and making nice UI things.</p>
						<p>Due to Laravel's strong recommendation, I write frontend code using Vue.js, which allows me to build reusable and modular frontend systems.</p>

                        </header>
                        <p>A year of working as a freelance developer was enough for me to decide that it wasn't for me. I didn't like writing code as fast as possible, then leaving the project and starting a new one for a new company. I believe that good work needs a whole programmer for a long time.</p>
                        <p>At this company, I'm creating a large company database from HTML files in pure PHP, without any framework. I have to process thousands of HTML files with multiple exceptions, which takes a lot of work.</p>
                        <p>Beside my main project I did two smaller things. The first was an HTML to PDF converter with custom HTML and CSS markup. Secondly, I created a small marketing site using Bootstrap.</p>

							<h3>Freelancer</h3>

						</header>
						<p>After my last job I decided to try a new work approach.</p>
						<p>Since then I worked on 4 bigger projects, which means I had to learn how to manage my time.</p>
						<p>The largest of these is made for a company where employees go to stores across the country and fill the shelves with products from different brands at these locations. The completed system handles the scheduling of these workers, in particular to ensure that there are no conflicts between them under certain conditions. In addition, through this system, employees report completed shelf uploads with images that managers can export from in all aspects.</p>
						<p>I had the opportunity to try to work at a company where I only had to deal with frontend development. Here I had to refactor a mobile-optimized web application in Vue.js.</p>
						<p>One of the smaller ongoing projects aims to create a credit product comparison web application. Here is my responsibility to create the complete code base (Laravel backend, Vue.js frontend).</p>
						<p>Currently, the main project is a language teacher intermediary website. I took over this project 4 months ago. A very cluttered code base is currently being refactored here.</p>

							<h3>SR Limnatis Holdings Ltd.</h3>
							<div>Senior Web Developer, 2021</div>
						</header>
						<p>In March I decided to move to a new company, I felt that I needed some new inspiration.</p>
						<p>I started working on adult sites here, which are significally bigger architectures than my previous jobs. I gained experice in multi-server architectures, message queues and recommendation systems. I made great development in testing, mainly using PHPUnit. Unfortunately, the company outsourced the development divison, so I only worked 3 months here.</p>

							<h3>Retalk Network Kft.</h3>
							<div>Senior Web Developer, 2020 &mdash; 2021</div>
						</header>
						<p>With the team of the 4Choice we started building a completely new social media site. <a href="https://retalk.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Retalk</a> works like Reddit, it has several interest-based discussion forums where people can talk about anything, but mostly politics.</p>
						<p>Like my other projects, it is based on Laravel, but we decided to use MongoDB for the database. Using Mongo requires an entirely different way of storing data and a new coding approach.</p>

							<h3>4Choice Ltd.</h3>
							<div>Senior Web Developer, 2017 &mdash; 2021</div>
						</header>
						<p>This has been a completely new challenge for me. 4Choice creates and runs price comparison and review websites, making sure that people are fully aware of what they're buying.</p>
						<p>After having worked with Wordpress for over a year, we started developing our very own CMS that would suit our business needs. Based on my advice, we went with Laravel and Vue.js frameworks. We built our CMS to allow for an unlimited amount of user-facing websites based on the same business logic. One of the examples is our primary website, <a href="https://proprivacy.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ProPrivacy</a>.</p>
						<p>My role in 4Choice is developing and maintaining the architecture of the CMS and the corresponding user-facing sites. I am also responsible for maintaining code quality.</p>

							<h3>Dericom Kft.</h3>
							<div>Web Developer, 2016 &mdash; 2017</div>
						</header>
						<p>My first real workplace. The company develops medical systems for family doctors and medical support systems for doctors and patients alike.</p>
						<p>During my time I developed an informational system for waiting rooms in Laravel, and several modules for the medical support system in Yii framework. Furthermore, I got deeper into MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Laravel Eloquent ORM.</p>
						<p>I got to learn what it's like to work with a really complex system, and I got more experienced in working in a team.</p>
